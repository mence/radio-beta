# Hammerspoon

[Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) is an automation engine for OSX written in
[Lua](http://www.lua.org/). It has access to the OSX APIs for pretty much everything in OSX,
and you can write code in Lua to execute direct Application calls or Applescripts. It also includes a nice [helper module for Spotify](http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.spotify.html).

## Test Example

[simple_test_example.lua](simple_test_example.lua) is a quick proof of concept of how you could drive Spotify from the user's perspective to check the behavior of the application. You definitely shouldn't use this for reals.
